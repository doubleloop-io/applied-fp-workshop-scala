/*
 * In OOP model object that encapsulate data and expose behaviours.
 * This two concepts are brigs together thanks to class definitions.
 *
 * In FP data and behaviours are modelled with two different tools:
 * - Algebraic Data Type (ADT) to model data
 * - Function to model behaviours
 *
 * An ADT is an immutable data structure that compose other types.
 * There are two common kinds of composition strategy:
 * - Product type: put many types together. e.g. struct in C, POJO in JAVA.
 *                 It's called product because all the possible values of a Tuple[String, Int] is
 *                 the *product* of all possible String with all possible Int.
 *                 Useful to model independent data in AND e.g. a Person is composed by a name *and* an age.
 *
 * - Sum type:     model exclusive types e.g. union in C, enum in JAVA.
 *                 Sum types correspond to disjoint unions of sets.
 *                 It's called sum because all the possible values of a Either[String, Int] is
 *                 the *sum* of all possible String with all possible Int.
 *                 Useful to model dependant data in OR e.g. the Light is on *or* off.
 *
 * We can mix ADT as we want, like a product type that compose a type with a sum type.

   * DESCRIPTION:
   *       It is played (let simplify) between two players with
   *       a standard Italian 40-card deck, divided into four suits: Cups, Golds, Swords, Clubs.
   *       The values on the cards range numerically from one through seven,
   *       plus three face cards in each suit: Knight (worth 8), Queen (worth 9) and King (worth 10).
   *       Each player receives three cards. The dealer will also place four cards face up on the table.
