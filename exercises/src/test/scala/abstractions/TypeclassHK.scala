/*
 * In a type system we deal with different kind of types.
 *
 * Type like Int, String, Date, Person, etc. are called
 * 'proper type'. In polymorphic function it is represented
 * by symbols like A, B, C, etc.
 * def sum[A](x: A, y: A): A = ???
 * These types have kind: *
 *
 * Instead types like List[A], Option[A], Box[A], etc.
 * are called 'type constructor', because they are open
 * until associated with a proper type like List[Int],
 * Option[String], Box[Person], etc. In the polymorphic
 * function definition nothing changes.
 * def concat[A](x: List[A], y: List[A]): List[A] = ???
 * These types have kind: * -> *
 * aka accepts a type and returns a type.
 *
 * In Scala and few others languages we can express
 * a function polymorphic over the type constructor.
 * def concat[F[_], A](x: F[A], y: F[A]): F[A] = ???
 * In these cases we talk about Higher-Order Kinds.
 * These types have kind: * -> * -> *
 * aka accepts a type constructor and returns
 * a type constructor.
 *
 * It's similar to the idea of High-Order Functions
 * aka function that accepts/returns other functions.
